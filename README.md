simple python script for generating and comparing camera calibrations for photos taken at varying focal lengths  
requires pictures to be saved in folders whose names are the focus value used in each folder,
script will output a matrix of focuses, fx, fy, and norms of the distortion vectors found.
also generates a plot comparing these values, and redrawn pictures
(using the found calibration) if desired.
